# Sepehr Solouki

## TL;DR
Having worked as a software engineer in various industries and teams, I successfully developed my focus and disipline to deliver production-grade quality software. This is a result of hard-working in pressured, well-structured, obsessive workplaces with skillful leaders.

Simultaneously, I am a super-fast learner and always seek for necessary changes and improvements in all levels of the organization.

I have strong communication skills and I am always told that I can understand people's concerns and discuss about the solution in my mind with ease.

### Cryo Administration (ETC):
A B2B web-application for hospitals and health-centers having cryogenic storage systems, aimed to help them manage their storage easier, works both offline and online.
•	https://cryo.etcuniverse.com

This application is aimed to work offline; so the logic is mainly implemented in the frontend. I've developed the entire frontend code.
